/* Text Ingrediënten You'll only need a few simple ingredients to make this bacon-wrapped chicken breast. The exact measurements are listed in the recipe card below. Here's an overview of what you'll need: Dijon mustard: This traditional French mustard is creamier and less vinegary than yellow mustard. I highly recommend it in this recipe. Honey: You can try using a sugar-free syrup if you wish. Chicken breasts: Try to find fairly small ones to ensure even cooking. Kosher salt and black pepper: Use less salt if using fine salt, or the dish could end up too salty. Garlic powder: Make sure it's fresh. A stale spice can easily ruin a dish. Bacon: I use thin-cut slices in this recipe. Thick-cut pieces won't work as well.
